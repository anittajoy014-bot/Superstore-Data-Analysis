#📊 Superstore-Data-Analysis

End-to-End Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis & Business Insights Using Python & Power BI

📁 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing Superstore sales data to uncover actionable business insights.

I performed complete data cleaning, transformation, analysis, and business question solving in Python, followed by creating an interactive Power BI dashboard for visualization.

The goal of this project is to understand key performance drivers such as category profitability, regional trends, customer segments, seasonal patterns, and the impact of discounts on profit.This project demonstrates my ability to work with real-world datasets, apply analytical thinking, and communicate insights effectively.


🔧 Tools & Technologies

Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

SQL (Conceptual business query breakdown)

Power BI (Interactive Dashboard)

Google Colab

GitHub for Version Control


1. Data Cleaning Steps

Performed using Python (Pandas):

🔹Removed null values and unnecessary columns

🔹Converted Order_Date into proper datetime format

🔹Extracted Month, Month_Number for trend analysis

🔹Standardized categorical values

🔹Verified data structure with .info(), .describe(), .value_counts()

🔹Added metrics such as total sales, total profit, average discount


2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in Python


✔ Sales & Profit Breakdown

🔹By Category

🔹By Region

🔹By Segment

🔹By Sub-Category

✔ Visualizations Created

🔹Sales by Category (bar chart)

🔹Profit by Category

🔹Sales & Profit by Segment

🔹Sales & Profit by Region

🔹Sub-Category profitability ranking

🔹Monthly Sales & Profit Trends

🔹Seasonal patterns using line charts

The visuals highlight which areas contribute most to revenue and which require attention.


3. Business Questions Answered
   

The project answers 14 important business questions using Python:

🔹Which Category contributes most to Sales?

🔹Which Category is most profitable?

🔹Which Sub-Category generates highest profit?

🔹Identifying loss-making Sub-Categories

🔹Region with highest sales

🔹Region with highest profit

🔹Segment with highest sales

🔹Most profitable Segment

🔹Which Segment needs attention (low profit / high discount)?

🔹What is the relationship between Discount and Profit?

🔹Are high discounts causing losses in any Sub-Category?

🔹Which Month has highest sales?

🔹Which Month has highest profit?

🔹Seasonal trends for Categories or Segments

Each question is answered with grouping, aggregation, and visualizations.


📈 4. Power BI Dashboard

An interactive Power BI dashboard was created to present:

🔹KPIs: Total Sales, Total Profit, Average Discount

🔹Category & Sub-Category performance

🔹Segment insights

🔹Region-wise revenue distribution

🔹Top & bottom performers

🔹Monthly sales & profit trends

🔹Dynamic filters for deep analysis


🚀 Key Insights  

🔹 Technology category generates strong profit

🔹 Furniture shows unstable profit due to discount-heavy items

🔹 West region performs consistently well

🔹 Consumer segment drives highest sales

🔹 High discounts significantly reduce profit in multiple sub-categories

🔹 November and December show peak seasonal activity

These insights can be used for strategic decisions like discount optimization, product focus, and regional expansion.
