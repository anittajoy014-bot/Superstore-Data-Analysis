#📊 Superstore-Data-Analysis

End-to-End Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis & Business Insights Using Python & Power BI

📁 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing Superstore sales data to uncover actionable business insights.

I performed complete data cleaning, transformation, analysis, and business question solving in Python, followed by creating an interactive Power BI dashboard for visualization.

The goal of this project is to understand key performance drivers such as category profitability, regional trends, customer segments, seasonal patterns, and the impact of discounts on profit.This project demonstrates my ability to work with real-world datasets, apply analytical thinking, and communicate insights effectively.


🔧 Tools & Technologies

Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

SQL (Conceptual business query breakdown)

Power BI (Interactive Dashboard)

Google Colab

GitHub for Version Control


1. Data Cleaning Steps

Performed using Python (Pandas):

Removed null values and unnecessary columns

Converted Order_Date into proper datetime format

Extracted Month, Month_Number for trend analysis

Standardized categorical values

Verified data structure with .info(), .describe(), .value_counts()

Added metrics such as total sales, total profit, average discount

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in Python


✔ Sales & Profit Breakdown

By Category

By Region

By Segment

By Sub-Category

✔ Visualizations Created

Sales by Category (bar chart)

Profit by Category

Sales & Profit by Segment

Sales & Profit by Region

Sub-Category profitability ranking

Monthly Sales & Profit Trends

Seasonal patterns using line charts

The visuals highlight which areas contribute most to revenue and which require attention.


3. Business Questions Answered
   

The project answers 14 important business questions using Python:

Which Category contributes most to Sales?

Which Category is most profitable?

Which Sub-Category generates highest profit?

Identifying loss-making Sub-Categories

Region with highest sales

Region with highest profit

Segment with highest sales

Most profitable Segment

Which Segment needs attention (low profit / high discount)?

What is the relationship between Discount and Profit?

Are high discounts causing losses in any Sub-Category?

Which Month has highest sales?

Which Month has highest profit?

Seasonal trends for Categories or Segments

Each question is answered with grouping, aggregation, and visualizations.


📈 4. Power BI Dashboard

An interactive Power BI dashboard was created to present:

KPIs: Total Sales, Total Profit, Average Discount

Category & Sub-Category performance

Segment insights

Region-wise revenue distribution

Top & bottom performers

Monthly sales & profit trends

Dynamic filters for deep analysis


🚀 Key Insights

🔹 Technology category generates strong profit

🔹 Furniture shows unstable profit due to discount-heavy items

🔹 West region performs consistently well

🔹 Consumer segment drives highest sales

🔹 High discounts significantly reduce profit in multiple sub-categories

🔹 November and December show peak seasonal activity

These insights can be used for strategic decisions like discount optimization, product focus, and regional expansion.
